## Hello, I'm Chris.

I'm a "full stack" software developer: I build end-to-end web applications with a focus on security and maintainability. 

I never shut up about static typing (❤️ Typescript) and shipping software that helps people.

If you'd like to get in contact with me, you can [email](mailto:me@chrishepner.info) or find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrishepner).
